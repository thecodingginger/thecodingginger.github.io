Today, we learnt about media and how  many types there are. It turns out that there are lots of types of media, and not a lot of them do not use the internet. e.g. leaflets and the radio are forms of media. We discussed how media has changed since the internet came  about. We also discussed which one is better out of social media or letters. I personally think that social media is betterbecause it is instant and free.
