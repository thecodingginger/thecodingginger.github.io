Today in IT we did some more coding with javascript on the micro.bit website as out microbits STILL have not arrived! The tutorials and the website in general are still a bit bugg, like when it keepsa not letting me onto my old format or when something goes into my snippets and never returns or getss deleted. I did manage to do a few more tutorials and learnt a fair bit on the way. All in all, an OK lesson.
