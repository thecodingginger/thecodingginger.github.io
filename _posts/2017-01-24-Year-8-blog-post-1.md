    <td>I learnt what to do by first watching Mr. Ampah Korsa's example at the front. He told us what to get and how to set up a fuzebox, which was relatively simple. We were then put in pairs and got materials. It was an easy setup with some minor setbacks. Then we had to look through the manual which helped us learn some of the basic commands on the box and monitor. The most effective strategy was reading the booklet thoroughly and checking our code with the example code.</td>

    <td>at first, nothing limited my learning. But then it became apparent that the fuzebox we set up with was broken, so we had dot get a new one. We were then behind. This was the only thing that limited our learning. I donâ€™t think I need to change any habits becausde we worked well and got lots done.</td>

    <td>The only thing I would change would be the speed I worked at. It was fine but it definitely could have been faster. I will improve my learning by reading and re-reading bits of the booklet to run over my knowledge. </td>
