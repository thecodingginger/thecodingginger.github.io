  <tr>
    <td>I would just work in my typing and reading put skill, as it slows us down a lot. I need to work on my habit of forgetfulness, as it can be bad if my partner doesn't have their memory stick, as I discovered a few weeks ago. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will improve my learning by paying attention to what I am reading or being told to write so that I will understand the concepts more. I cannot think what I would change for next time as the lesson went pretty much according to plan.</td>
