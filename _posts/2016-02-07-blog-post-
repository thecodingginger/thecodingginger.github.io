Today we talked even MORE about media and social media. In groups of 3, we made up 10 basic rules of social media that would cover everything that you would ever need to worry about. At least, that was the idea. We then watched a video in which one person was no on their phone but all their friends and family were ignoring them by being 'antisocial.' even though they werenâ€™t speaking to their frieand, they were being social on social media. So we talked about having too much of anything is bad for you.
