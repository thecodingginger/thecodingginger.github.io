    <td>th main thing at limited my learning today was the fact I was rushing and so I kept accidentally typing things wrong. Also, I kept forgetting what semicolons, inverted commas and commas were called, so that slowed us down a bit</td>

    <td>The only thing I would change would be the speed I worked at. It was fine but it definitely could have been faster. I will improve my learning by reading and re-reading bits of the booklet to run over my knowledge, and also straying away from the booket and replacing things written with other things so that I fully understand what aver bit of coding is for</td>
