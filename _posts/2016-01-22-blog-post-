today we did more on media. We did an excersice whare we all had to stand in crtain parts of the room to show wether we disagreed or agreed and to what extent we had this belief. We then talked about peer pressure and how it can do things to what you think and how you act. After that, we talked about reality TV and social media and how, to a certain extent, they are the same because you are 'showcasing' your life in a way that is probably false to people.
