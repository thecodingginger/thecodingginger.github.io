    <td> I learnt well this lesson. We were efficient in our work and moved slickly, in my opinion. Lots of the work we did was relatively simple, so the only strategies I really used was just looking at the booklet and putting in code. In fact, it was so easy to grasp that Sam, my partner, and I were adding ad changing string values to make different messages to print! It was the most fun yet.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>one thing that limited my learning was the fact that my type style and the keyboard didn't go together. I know that doesn't really limit me but it probably kept me behind by about 5 mins. I kept putting in the wrong words and my spelling was awful! I also need to make sure i start using the shif key rather than the caps lock key.</td>
