today we did some more e-safety and all that. The main thing we did in the lesson was watch a series of youtube videos about a girl and her friends and her brother and his freinds doing a competition in wich the group that gets a million youtube veiws on a video wins. However, this gets out of hand and it ends up with the sister's friend filming a sex tape of his freindâ€™s brother and girlfreind. This teaches a lesson that you always have to make the right coices, and you should never take anything too far. We also learnt what to do if we were in this kind of situation. It was a really interesting lesson and I hope we have another one like it soon.
