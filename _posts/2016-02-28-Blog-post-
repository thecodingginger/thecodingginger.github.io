hello for the final time.Today we went round the room and marked and  commented on each other's identity maps. I found that making my identity map was quite easy and fun, beacuse it was all about me, and that is one of my specialities. It was a really good idea to present and mark them this way, as it lets anyone say anything about anyone’s map, but anonymously.Sharing it this way was good beacuse  the people marking it could have said anything that they wanted to about my map. Some of my comments I didn’t enjoy writing, a some maps just didn’t do much that they were supposed to. I would rather have done the process like this rather than directly comment face to face, because you can be completely honest with yourself. All the comments of my work I agreed with. Like I said, doing it this way worked realyy well beacuse of the  honesty involved. I don’t think I would change anything I use in media after doing this activity. These six lessons haven’t really changed my opinion on social media but i am a bit more analytical when it comes to the the media and social media.
