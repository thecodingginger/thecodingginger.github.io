Today in IT (which isn't really IT anymore; it’s more communication and media studies) we were talking about presentation. We defined it and talked about it. Then we started to talk about a innovative and exciting presentation software and tool called Prezo. Prezo’s USP is  a zoom. Lots of things have a zoom. But prezo uses the  zoom to a massive advantage because there are no slides in prezo. Instead everything is in one slide and you zoom in to minute dots or tiny details.
